        Overall, this has been a wonderful opportunity. I would recommend everyone to try for it. This program has given me the perfect launchpad for my journey in the Computer Science domain. You can give it a read here!

        <h2>PUZZLED GIRL <a href = "https://medium.com/@aman1712/puzzled-anvesha-3c68398961bd">(link)</a></h2>
<i>“The world is a very puzzling place</br>
If youre not willing to be puzzled,</br>
you just become a replica of someone elses mind.</br></i>
-Naom Chomsky</br>
A girl, just 19 yrs old,</br>
Yes its me,</br>
who once loved biology but ended up taking math.</br>
her interest in arts makes her crafty!</br>
but as we all know, she was brainy !!</br>
enormously trying to do whatever she really loves to</br>
but the absoluteness of this world doesnt allow her………</br>
Then one day……… after the JEE result,</br>
she was entering in her college life………</br>
and also started running for her 20's…feeling like a Bollywood heroine…</br>
ha haha….. just because of the bois in engineering colleges….</br>
she started dreaming of friendly faces,</br>
As she got so much time to kill…</br>
Then…another “one day” came in her life…..</br>
In the digital world, accessing a lot of content….</br>
being aware of the importance of what she consumes…</br>
is being lost somewhere..</br>
Now, countless questions are jabbing her…</br>
Majoring about the career choice!!!</br>
OMG! from the very first year!!!! but yes its true……</br>
The loquacious girl, spending her time well in coding,</br>
sometimes doing web development….</br>
some days scrolls away as fast as her instagram screen….</br>
some in creating profiles, learning and developing.</br>
some in account of her so called “Computer Science” Branch!!</br>
sometimes justifying her acts to herself!!</br>
that things are going good, whereas its just opposite.</br>
Contemplating herself she realized…. and tried to conclude….</br>
Lets just listen to her carefully…..</br></br>
I wanna be a Developer, sometimes a tester!!</br>
sometimes, just a job in GOOGLE will be enough! Oh! I wish one day...</br>
At times, seeing my acting skills… I wanna be an actor!</br>
even and again thinking about my art career!</br>
once in a “while” wanna be a Youtuber!</br>

Ah, there where I am? (asking oneself)</br>
Nobody including me knows…..</br>
Now just end up things done on a daily bases</br>
leaving the final decision on karma….</br>
Now just creating a bigger version of myself and restoring the lost faith in myself…</br>
being fearful, I will live my life as a trial and error….. just believing…</br>
<i>“You may never know</br>
what results come from your actions,</br>
but if you do nothing,</br>
there will be no results.”</br></i>
— Mahatma Gandhi.</br>
